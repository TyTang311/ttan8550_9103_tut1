# Quiz 8

## Part 1: Imaging Technique Inspiration

The art project I feel very inspiring created by Yayoi Kusama called The Obliteration Room. She set up a plain white room and let people go in and put round stickers of all colors anywhere they wished. As time passes, more people enter the room and more stickers are put up, and the original white room seems to be gradually being obliterated.
I think the multi-coloured stickers that get more over time are a good example of random and real-time.

## Part 2: Coding Technique Exploration

I found a patch of code that simulates Mitosis. It implements a click on a circle, and that circle will split into two circles. The click function can be changed to sound interaction or real-time in the final project. As participants interacted the circle continued to split and finally formed a pattern.
