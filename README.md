# Quiz 8

## Part 1: Imaging Technique Inspiration

I find Yayoi Kusama's art project, "The Obliteration Room," incredibly inspiring. She created a plain white room and allowed people to enter and place round stickers of various colors anywhere they wished. Over time, as more people participated, more stickers were added, gradually obliterating the original white room. 

I believe this project's use of multi-colored stickers accumulating in real-time is a great example of randomness and real-time interaction.

## Part 2: Coding Technique Exploration

I came across a piece of code that simulates Mitosis. It enables a click on a circle, causing it to split into two circles. This click function can be adapted for sound interaction or real-time interaction in the final project. As participants interact, the circle continues to split and eventually forms a pattern.

You can find an example of this code [here](https://editor.p5js.org/codingtrain/sketches/K_ABj0cCt).
